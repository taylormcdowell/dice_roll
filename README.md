# Dice Roller
A simple dice-rolling application with cheesy dice image display.

# Setup/Running
Clone this to your machine (ex. ~/Desktop/dice_roll).
Then run this in command line:

+ cd Desktop
+ cd dice_roll
+ ruby dice_roll.rb

# Playing
Type in a number for dice roll count (you will see dice images after pressing "Enter/Return").
All dice results will be added together for total.
Have fun!
